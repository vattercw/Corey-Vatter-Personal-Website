						Hello there! I'd like to take a moment to thank you for visiting my website.<br/><br/>

						I've been attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana since 2012, with the hopes of graduating in May, 2016 with a BS double major in computer science and software engineering. I've also been fortunate enough to spend my entire junior year abroad at the University of Aizu in Fukushima, Japan where I studied forensic linguistics and machine learning techniques.<br/><br/> 

						I'm the youngest of three brothers, and grew up having strong work ethic just to keep up with them. I continue to play tennis and shoot archery in my spare time. I also collect coins, books, video games and vinyl records.<br/><br/>

						<b>My father always told me to find a career where I'd never stop learning.</b>
						<br/><br/>

						I've always had a thirst of knowledge, and I pride myself on my desire to be a well rounded individual. I have a love for science, technology, sports, music, history, writing and culture. Ever since I could remember I've been curious about the world we live in &mdash; both culturally and scientifically. I continually try to learn new things about the world we live in and the people that inhabit it.
